## Forge version
This version is the inferior one, as it was designed to be as minimal as possible. Configuration is chat dependant, which is painful to work with.


### How to use

You can toggle it with the Keybind, which you should set yourself in the Controls Menu (should be "I" key by default). <br>
When toggling, a chat message of it's state in the chat. <br>

If you have it enabled then just cast your rod and wait!
